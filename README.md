## Hi there 👋, I'm William - DevOps / Cloud Engineer

I'm an Azure-certified DevOps & Cloud Engineer passionate about infrastructure automation, cloud architecture, and building scalable systems. My core expertise lies in Azure, Terraform, Bicep, and CI/CD workflows, but I also have a strong foundation in software development from earlier roles and projects.

This GitHub portfolio includes **legacy software engineering projects** that showcase my early programming experience and technical growth. While I now focus on cloud infrastructure and automation, I’m proud of these projects and continue to apply many of the same development principles in my DevOps work.

## 💼 What I Focus On Now

- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Azure-first, with multi-cloud capabilities
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Bicep, Terraform
- **CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- **Identity & Access Management:** Microsoft Entra ID
- **DevOps Best Practices:** Secure, scalable systems and automation pipelines
